# event-emitter-examples

A few basic examples I made to illustrate using Event Emitter

1. [basic-example](./basic-example) - A basic pure javascript example of consuming the various functions of Event Emitter
2. [gpu-stock-example](./gpu-stock-example) - A basic example of extending Event Emitter and having different clients add their own event handlers
2. [job-runner-example](./job-runner-example) - A basic example of a multi-phased event interaction that can be dynamically generated based on constructor input
